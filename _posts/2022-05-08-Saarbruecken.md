### How we ended up in Saarbrücken
We spent the weekend close to Metz attending a beautiful wedding. Friends said *oui* in this gorgeous location.

On our way back home, we stopped in Saarbrücken to check out some local climbing gym.

### Where we climbed
There are several climbing gyms in Saarbrücken. We decided to check out Kletterzentrum Saarbrücken and enjoyed it a lot.

The atmosphere was amazing with big windows in the bouldering area. The rope climbing area provided nice routes and a huge roof. Definitely worth a visit. A 5/5 boulder brushes experience!

### Where to eat
Just down the street is a café called *Johanna cafétéria*. The menu includes many vegan or vegetarian options. The waiter's recommendation was the carrot cake, which was definitely among the best of its kind. If you want to sit outside, it is unfortunately right next to the street. Other than that, a great cafe - 4/5 pieces of cake.
