### Where we stayed

This time around we stayed in the medieval town Moret-sur-Loing, which not only is picturesque but also offers good food and traditional candy.

Moret sur Loing had some nice [sights](https://moretloingetorvanne.fr/moret-loing-et-orvanne/patrimoine/moret-sur-loing/) to visit on our off days. Apart from the old city center and church there were some incredible mansions spread throughout the town. Especially Maison Clemenceau that you can view from across the Loing when strolling through [Espace Naturel Sensible de la Prairie Clemenceau](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Espace+Naturel+Sensible+de+la+Prairie+Clemenceau/@48.3683412,2.8214515,576m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m6!3m5!1s0x47ef5e2925a4a26d:0xc709dd333c8abc16!8m2!3d48.3685299!4d2.8235088!16s%2Fg%2F11fy4jp9ph).

### Where we climbed

We spent our first two days in *Apremont Ouest* and *Apremont Butte aux Dames* projecting [Powerslave]({{ "/assets/font3/powerslave.mp4" | relative_url }}) and [Insoumise]({{ "/assets/font3/insoumise.mp4" | relative_url }})

We took two rest days and checked out the areas *Gorge aux Châts* and *La Ségognole*
[orange circuit]({{ "/assets/font3/orange31.mp4" | relative_url }}). Both areas are easily accessible and were therefore crowded with families.  

On Friday we met up with Friends in *Maunoury*. The circuit boulders were all quite high but we found some other nice boulder gems such as [Bingo Wings]({{ "/assets/font3/bingowings.mp4" | relative_url }}).

Next to La Ségognole there is *Roche aux Oiseaux* where we found the boulders [Sophie]({{ "/assets/font3/sophie.mp4" | relative_url }}) and [Transylvania]({{ "/assets/font3/transylvania.mp4" | relative_url }}).
