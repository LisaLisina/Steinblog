Petrohrad is a granite boulder area in the Czech Republic, which is sometimes referred to as the Czech Fontainebleau because of the boulder density in the area. The stone is grippy and a true skin destroyer due to its tiny spikes.

### Where we stayed
At the campsite in Jesenice. As we only stayed for the weekend, we decided to go for the full camping experience and stayed in our lightweight tent. For those who prefer a little cabin, you can rent one there.

### Where we climbed
On the first day we climbed in Zihle, Sklárna sever. Here's a picture of the boulder Dvoupatrák where Paul sent the boulder problem of the same name. Paul's send was the most successful part of the day, other than that we walked a lot, we tried a lot and suffered a lot :)

On the second day, we checked out a different area. I will add the information if I find out where it was ;)

### Where to eat
Restaurace Tom in Kryry - in general it was quite hard to find vegetarian food in this area. However, all restaurants put together their vegeterian stuff and created delicousness for us. Don't forget to try *knedlíky* when you are around :)
