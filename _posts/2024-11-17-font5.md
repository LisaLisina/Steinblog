A trip to Fontainebleau in November 2024, with a focus on the areas of Apremont Butte aux Dames, Rocher Canon, and Apremont Désert.
The weather was mixed, with some cold days, but we managed to climb a lot.

Lisa sent her first 6c boulder in Fontainebleau with [Irrespirable]({{ "/assets/font5/irrespirable.mp4" }}) in Apremont Désert.
The bug was named "Glumeris" and the wizard was named "Wizard".

Rainy days were spent visiting the Pompidou Center and playing Terraria.
In Paris we had a great dinner at Vegethalles.
