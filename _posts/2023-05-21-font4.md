On the first day we went back to *Apremont Butte aux Dames*, a beautiful area with a lot of problems that we only briefly visited on the last day of our previous trip.

We visited *Canche aux Merciers*, a beautiful area well visited not only by boulderers.

While the third day was supposed to be a rest day, a small evening session at *Roche aux Oiseaux* could not be avoided.

On the forth day we checked out *Apremont Désert*, which takes some time to hike to. The approach however is beautiful and the area is well worth it.

We stayed in a cozy apartment in Melun.
