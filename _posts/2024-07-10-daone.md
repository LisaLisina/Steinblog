We had holidays for only a short 5 days and originally planned to go to central Austria, however the weather forecast was not looking good
We decided to go to Valle di Daone in Italy instead.

## Where we stayed
We rented a small apartment in Tione di Trento. 
The apartment was very nice and the village had nice restaurants, cafes and a weekly market.
We got great breakfast croissants from the bakery and had dinner at the pizzeria and indian place close to our apartment.
The best pizza we got was at La Grosta, a pizzeria a few villages over.

## Where we climbed

The first day we went to a small bouldering crag in Val di Genova. Most of the blocks were off limits, had bad landings, or overgrown.
We climbed a few easy problems, but it was incredibly hot as well so we went swimming in the beautiful river instead.

The next 2 days we explored crags in Valle di Daone, which were much better.
We climbed in the sectors Dos dei Aser and La Plana.
