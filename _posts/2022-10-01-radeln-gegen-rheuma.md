title: Radeln gegen Rheuma &#35;RGR101
---
On the first of October we went on a bike tour of 101 km, which did not end at some climbing crag. You wonder, why did we do it then?

The department of rheumatology at the University Hospital Göttingen organised this event to raise money and awareness for rare autoimmune diseases and research in the field. For more information about the event, listen to the latest podcast episode of ["101 Dinge die ein Rennradfahrer wissen muss"](https://rennradfahren101.podigee.io/71-radeln-gegen-rheuma-rgr101).

Starting at the University Hospital Göttingen, the tour brought us to Herzberg im Harz - through pouring rain. Herzberg was shortly before the 50km hallmark, so we had a short break to satisfy the need for coffee and sugar before we left for the second part of the journey.

We were going through some ups and downs during the journey - and not just literally (see the height profile on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/routes/3007416701841065722), though). The ride was quite adventurous. We had to cross bridges where there turned out to be no bridges. All hurdles aside, we managed to finish the ride after 6 long hours.
