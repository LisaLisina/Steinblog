title: Retour à Fontainebleau
---
Why go to Fontainebleau, you wonder? Then you haven't read our first Fontainebleau post, which you should definitely do first! :)

It was our second time in Fontainebleau, so we kind of had an idea what awaited us. Our major objectives for this trip were:
* check out more areas
* climb hard
* don't injure shoulder (more) and
* find even better *canelés*

This time we managed to take a picture of the *canelés*. Were they even better? Hard to say, in any case, they were incredibly delicious.

### Where we stayed
We rented an apartment in Bourron-Marlotte, which is located 15 min south of Fontainebleau by car. It was a tiny house to ourselves on an empty horse ranch - a lot of privacy therefore. The bouldering area "Restant du Long Rocher" was within walking distance. There also was an amazing bakery, unfortunately a little bit too far to walk there in the morning - at least for a person who's grumpy without breakfast and coffee.

4/5 stars!

### Where we climbed
This time around, we didn't put any hope in the printed guides anymore. We worked our way through using 27crags and [bleau.info](bleau.info). Some boulder areas were so stunning last time that we definitely had to come back, others still needed to be explored. And many more still need to be explored, a comeback to Fontainebleau is therefore guaranteed.

#### Restant du Long Rocher
In our experience it's a quiet and less frequented area, however offering some hidden gems. For Fontainebleau conditions the fall zone often is rather bad and some boulders are pretty high. Starting off with some red circuit boulders, we soon realized that we wouldn't try all the circuit boulders due to either height or a bad fall zone. Looking for a good try hard boulder, we found "Elixir de Bouldering". It's a beautiful sloper travers. Unfortunately, the last slopers and the exit were wet, making it impossible to project it. Definitely a boulder on the tick list for next spring.

When we returned, it was to find a 6b boulder problem for Lisa, which turned out to be an awkward sit start move called  [*L'Arpenteur du Restant*]({{ "/assets/font2/larpenteurdurestant.mp4" | relative_url }}).

3/5 boulder brushes!

#### Aprement Ouest and Aprement Buttes aux Dames
Apprement Ouest is incredible. Paul continued crushing the red circuit. This time we also explored the adjacent area Aprement Buttes aux Dames and there are still many more areas to explore. This is definitely an all time favourite! There are beautiful lines of all grades. We found some beautiful lines for a decent last day of our holidays. The highlights were [*blocage tonique*]({{ "/assets/font2/blocagetonique.mp4" | relative_url }}) and [*la rampe*]({{ "/assets/font2/larampe.mp4" | relative_url }}), both 6a.

5/5 boulder brushes!

#### 95.2
This area is named after its peak, which is 95.2 metres high and the highest hill in the area. It's among others famous for the 7a boulder *Retour aux sources*, where Paul tried some moves, of course. The project will be continued in the future. To sum up our experience in 95.2: it was [*hot*]({{ "/assets/font2/hot.mp4" | relative_url }}), 6a.

4/5 boulder brushes!

#### Rocher Canon
This area offers beautiful circuits as well as try hard projects, as there are many overhanging boulders. In contrast to most other boulder spots in Fontainebleau, this one can be reached by train. We went there on a sunny Saturday, little surprise that it was crowded. We might come back for further exploration.

3/5 boulder brushes!

### Off days and non-climbing activities
Off days did not exist, we climbed eight days in a row - can not recommend, though. Crushing hard was not possible after so many hard attempts and days. Lesson learned for the next holiday.

#### Dinner in Paris
We went to Paris to meet a friend for dinner. Despite being close to Paris, going there was more of a challenge than anticipated. Paris introduced a rather large "lower emission zone", which makes a spontaneous trip by car impossible, as you can get the batch online only. We therefore went to Massy by car and switched to the regional train there. Driving close to Paris admittedly in rush hour felt like a near death experience anyways, so taking the train was an amazing option - and cheap at the same time, just took some time and it was quite crowded.
We headed to [Aujourd'hui Demain](https://aujourdhui-demain.com), a vegan concept store and restaurant located in the 11th arrondissement, which is a modern and dynamic area of Paris.

#### Arkham horror
The horror returned to Arkham - this time in form of a card game. Trish Scarborough and William Yorick were stuck in Innsmouth fighting fish-like creatures.

### Where to eat
* Brasserie des O'Pignons à Milly-la-Forêt - unfortunately only limited vegetarian (no vegan) options, delicious collection of side dishes and desserts
* La Pizzeria à Moret-sur-Loing - good Pizza, just don't be misled by the delicious-looking chocolate Pizza on Google, they might not have it
* Ô dix sept à Bourron-Marlotte - rich Pizza after a tough climbing day, the Calzone Choc-aux-pommes was a good choice
* La Folie Barbizon - highly recommend brunch on Sundays, great atmosphere
# ![folie]({{ "/assets/font2/folie.jpeg" | relative_url }}) *Too excited for bouldering after the brunch, came back after the session for the photo*
* [Boulanger-Pâtissier Le Fournil](https://goo.gl/maps/M1HwPZXghRNgnXJB6/) à Montigny-sur-Loing - the best french bakery so far!!!
# ![table]({{ "/assets/font2/table.jpeg" | relative_url }}) *Canelés in the centre, delicousness all over*
