The Bismarckstein is a monument near the Klausberg in GÃ¶ttingen. It was erected in 1902 to honor the first German *Reichskanzler* Otto von Bismarck. Due to its shape, it's often referred to as *Elefantenklo* (elephant toilet). When we learned that the Bismarckstein is known for urban bouldering in the climbing scene, we had to test it. It is a fun traverse around the entire monument. The beautiful bike approach, nice view and fun boulding make it definitely worth a visit.
