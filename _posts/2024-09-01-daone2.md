We returned to Tione di Trento with our lovely friends.
This time around we also wanted to try out some sportclimbing.

We first visited la Vela - a crag close to the city center of Trento. While the crag was not so scenic the routes were amazing.
We checked out the climbing crag of Val Lomasone. The crag was quite heterogenously bolted but all together a scenic place with fun routes for everyone.

We also checked out some more bouldering areas of Val di Daone. A true highlight was Nudole with some iconic boulders around a little alpine farm. They sell cheese and honey.

Food in Italy was a blast - as always.

On a rainy day we checked out the sportclimbing crag in Tione di Trento (Tione - Brevine). There was a scary barking dog on the very narrow footpath leading to the crag. Therefore we spent our last sunny day bouldering at La Plana instead.
