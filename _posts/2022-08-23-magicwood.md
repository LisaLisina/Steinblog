The classic magic wood sign is located at the north entrance to the forest. Arriving by car, we usually parked further down the road in Ausserferrera and entered from the south.

### Where we stayed
We rented an apartment in Sufers, which is about 10min from Ausserferrera by car. The apartment was located next to the grocery store Prima Dorfladen, which provided delicious Nussstangen (nut sticks) for breakfast.

### Sends
We got the Bouldertopo Magic Wood-Bloc at the local restaurant Edelweiss in Ausserferrera and managed to find some of the true classics and also some forgotten and obscure lines in the forest.

### Rainy days
Rainy days did not provide much recovery as we had to battle the horrors of Arkham and unleash full nerd power.

After banishing the forces of evil, we were left with an empty stomach. Across the border, in Italy, we found a nice Pizza place in Montespluga called La Capriata. Yummy.
